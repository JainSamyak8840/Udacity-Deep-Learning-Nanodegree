## Project
Throughout this Nanodegree program, i'll have the opportunityto prove your skills by building the following projects-

### 1. Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns
Build and train neural networks from scratch to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day.

In this project, i was got to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset.

The data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).

### 2. Dog-Breed Classifier
Design and train a convolutional neural network to analyze images of dogs and correctly identify their breeds. Use transfer learning and well-known architectures to improve this model—this is excellent preparation for more advanced applications.

### 3. Optimize Your GitHub Profile
GitHub Profiles are a key piece of "evidence" to an employer that you'd be a good job candidate, because they can see the details of your work. Recruiters use GitHub as a way to find job candidates, and many Nanodegree alumni have received work opportunities from their activity on GitHub. In addition, using GitHub is a way for you to collaborate on projects with other programmers - this will show that you are able to work well with others on an engineering team on the job.


### 4. Generate TV Scripts
Build a recurrent neural network on TensorFlow to process text. Use it to generate new episodes of your favorite TV show, based on old scripts.


### 5. Generate Faces
Build a pair of multi-layer neural networks and make them compete against each other in order to generate new, realistic faces. Try training them on a set of celebrity faces, and see what new faces the computer comes out with!

### 6. Improve your LinkedIn

### 7. Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model
Train and deploy your own PyTorch sentiment analysis model. You’ll build a model and create a gateway for accessing it from a website.
