## Core Curriculum

### 1. Introduction to Deep Learning
Get your first taste of deep learning by applying style transfer to your own images, and gain experience using development tools such as Anaconda and Jupyter notebooks.


### 2. Neural Networks
Learn neural networks basics, and build your first network with Python and NumPy. Use the modern deep learning framework PyTorch to build multi-layer neural networks, and analyze real data.

### 3. Convolutional Neural Networks
Learn how to build convolutional networks and use them to classify images (faces, melanomas, etc.) based on patterns and objects that appear in them. Use these networks to learn data compression and image denoising.

### 4. Recurrent Neural Networks
Build your own recurrent networks and long short-term memory networks with PyTorch; perform sentiment analysis and use recurrent networks to generate new text from TV scripts.

### 5. Generative Adversarial Networks
Learn to understand and implement a Deep Convolutional GAN (generative adversarial network) to generate realistic images, with Ian Goodfellow, the inventor of GANs, and Jun-Yan Zhu, the creator of CycleGANs.

### 6. Deploying a Model
Train and deploy your own PyTorch sentiment analysis model. Deployment gives you the ability to use a trained model to analyze new, user input. Build a model, deploy it, and create a gateway for accessing it from a website.

## Project

### 1. Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns
Build and train neural networks from scratch to predict the number of bikeshare users on a given day.

In this project, i was got to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset.

The data comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).

### 2. Dog-Breed Classifier
Design and train a convolutional neural network to analyze images of dogs and correctly identify their breeds. Use transfer learning and well-known architectures to improve this model—this is excellent preparation for more advanced applications.

### 3. Optimize Your GitHub Profile
GitHub Profiles are a key piece of "evidence" to an employer that you'd be a good job candidate, because they can see the details of your work. Recruiters use GitHub as a way to find job candidates, and many Nanodegree alumni have received work opportunities from their activity on GitHub. In addition, using GitHub is a way for you to collaborate on projects with other programmers - this will show that you are able to work well with others on an engineering team on the job.


### 4. Generate TV Scripts
Build a recurrent neural network on TensorFlow to process text. Use it to generate new episodes of your favorite TV show, based on old scripts.


### 5. Generate Faces
Build a pair of multi-layer neural networks and make them compete against each other in order to generate new, realistic faces. Try training them on a set of celebrity faces, and see what new faces the computer comes out with!

### 6. Improve your LinkedIn

### 7. Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model
Train and deploy your own PyTorch sentiment analysis model. You’ll build a model and create a gateway for accessing it from a website.
