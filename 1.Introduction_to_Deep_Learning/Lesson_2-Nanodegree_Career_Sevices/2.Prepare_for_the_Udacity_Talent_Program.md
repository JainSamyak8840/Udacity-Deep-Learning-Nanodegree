Through the [Udacity Talent Program](https://www.udacity.com/get-hired), Nanodegree graduates can share their skills and experience with employers looking to specifically hire Udacity Talent. Employers can source through lists of Udacity graduates (stack ranked by skills) and reach out with invitations to apply to jobs.

In order to be a part of the Udacity Talent Program, you need to:
* Graduate from a Nanodegree program
* Complete your Udacity Profile
* Upload your resume to your Udacity Profile. While your Udacity Profile helps us share information with employers, they care most about your resume. Remember to take advantage of the Resume Review Career Service in your Career Portal.
* Toggle the share status of your profile to Public. Udacity won't share any of your information without your permission.


### How to Complete Your Udacity Profile

Once you are in your Career Portal, you can click on Edit Profile to upload a profile picture, add your preferred email to receive employer communications, and upload a resume. You can also set any work preferences to help with job matching.

### How to Share Skills

Talent Program employers will see your profile tagged with Nanodegree program skills, and any skills you include in your resume. Remember to have a clear Skills section in your resume!
